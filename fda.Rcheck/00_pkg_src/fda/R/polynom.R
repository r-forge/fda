polynom <- function (x, norder=1, ctr=midrange, nderiv)
{
#  This computes values of the polynomials,
#        P_l(x) = (x-ctr)^l, l=0,...,NORDER-1
#  or their derivatives.
#  The degree of the highest order polynomial is one less than NORDER.
#  The default is the constant function.

#  Arguments are as follows:
#  X      ... array of values at which the polynomials are to
#             evaluated
#  NORDER ... the polynomial basis object
#  NDERIV ... highest order derivative.  0 means only function values
#             are returned.
#  CTR    ... a constant to be subtracted from a value prior to taking
#             its power
#  Return is a matrix with length(X) rows and NORDER columns containing
#  the values of the polynomials
