_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Create an exponential basis object defining a set of exponential
     functions with rate constants in argument ratevec.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     create.exponential.basis(rangeval=c(0,1), nbasis=NULL, ratevec=NULL,
                              dropind=NULL, quadvals=NULL, values=NULL,
                              basisvalues=NULL, names='exp')

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

rangeval: a vector of length 2 containing the initial and final values
          of the interval over which the functional data object can be
          evaluated. 

  nbasis: the number of basis functions.  Default =
          'if(is.null(ratevec)) 2 else length(ratevec)'. 

 ratevec: a vector of length 'nbasis' of rate constants defining basis
          functions of the form 'exp(rate*x)'.  Default = 0:(nbasis-1). 

 dropind: a vector of integers specifiying the basis functions to be
          dropped, if any.  For example, if it is required that a
          function be zero at the left boundary, this is achieved by
          dropping the first basis function, the only one that is
          nonzero at that point. 

quadvals: a matrix with two columns and a number of rows equal to the
          number of quadrature points for numerical evaluation of the
          penalty integral.  The first column of 'quadvals' contains
          the quadrature points, and the second column the quadrature
          weights.  A minimum of 5 values are required for each
          inter-knot interval, and that is often enough.  For Simpson's
          rule, these points are equally spaced, and the weights are
          proportional to 1, 4, 2, 4, ..., 2, 4, 1. 

  values: a list of matrices with one row for each row of 'quadvals'
          and one column for each basis function.  The elements of the
          list correspond to the basis functions and their derivatives
          evaluated at the quadrature points contained in the first
          column of 'quadvals'. 

basisvalues: A list of lists, allocated by code such as
          vector("list",1).  This field is designed to avoid evaluation
          of a basis system repeatedly at a set of argument values. 
          Each list within the vector corresponds to a specific set of
          argument values, and must have at least two components, which
          may be tagged as you wish.  `The first component in an
          element of the list vector contains the argument values.  The
          second component in an element of the list vector contains a
          matrix of values of the basis functions evaluated at the
          arguments in the first component.  The third and subsequent
          components, if present, contain matrices of values their
          derivatives up to a maximum derivative order.  Whenever
          function getbasismatrix is called, it checks the first list
          in each row to see, first, if the number of argument values
          corresponds to the size of the first dimension, and if this
          test succeeds, checks that all of the argument values match. 
          This takes time, of course, but is much faster than
          re-evaluation of the basis system.  Even this time can be
          avoided by direct retrieval of the desired array.  For
          example, you might set up a vector of argument values called
          "evalargs" along with a matrix of basis function values for
          these argument values called "basismat".  You might want too
          use names like "args" and "values", respectively for these. 
          You would then assign them to 'basisvalues' with code such as
          the following:

          basisobj$basisvalues <- vector("list",1)

          basisobj$basisvalues[[1]] <- list(args=evalargs,
          values=basismat) 

   names: either a character vector of the same length as the number of
          basis functions or a simple stem used to construct such a
          vector.

          For 'monomial' bases, this defaults to paste('monomial',
          1:nbreaks, sep=''). 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Exponential functions are of the type $exp(bx)$ where $b$ is the
     rate constant.  If $b = 0$, the constant function is defined.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a basis object with the type 'expon'.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'basisfd', 'create.bspline.basis', 'create.constant.basis',
     'create.fourier.basis', 'create.monomial.basis',
     'create.polygonal.basis', 'create.polynomial.basis',
     'create.power.basis'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     #  Create an exponential basis over interval [0,5]
     #  with basis functions 1, exp(-t) and exp(-5t)
     basisobj <- create.exponential.basis(c(0,5),3,c(0,-1,-5))
     #  plot the basis
     plot(basisobj)
