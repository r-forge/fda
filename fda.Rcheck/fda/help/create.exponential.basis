_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Create an exponential basis object defining a set of exponential
     functions with rate constants in argument ratevec.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     create.exponential.basis(rangeval=c(0,1), nbasis=1,
                              ratevec=1, dropind=NULL,
                              quadvals=NULL, values=NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

rangeval: a vector of length 2 containing the initial and final values
          of the interval over which the functional data object can be
          evaluated. 

  nbasis: the number of basis functions. 

 ratevec: a vector of length 'nbasis' of rate constants defining basis
          functions of the form 'exp(rate*x)'. 

 dropind: a vector of integers specifiying the basis functions to be
          dropped, if any.  For example, if it is required that a
          function be zero at the left boundary, this is achieved by
          dropping the first basis function, the only one that is
          nonzero at that point. Default value NULL. 

quadvals: a matrix with two columns and a number of rows equal to the
          number of argument values used to approximate an integral
          using Simpson's rule.  The first column contains these
          argument values. A minimum of 5 values are required for each
          inter-knot interval, and that is often enough. These are
          equally spaced between two adjacent knots. The second column
          contains the weights used for Simpson's rule.  These are
          proportional to 1, 4, 2, 4, ..., 2, 4, 1. 

  values: a list containing the basis functions and their derivatives
          evaluated at the quadrature points contained in the first
          column of ' quadvals '. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Exponential functions are of the type $exp(bx)$ where $b$ is the
     rate constant.  If $b = 0$, the constant function is defined.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a basis object with the type 'expon'.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'basisfd',  'create.bspline.basis',  'create.constant.basis', 
     'create.fourier.basis',  'create.monomial.basis', 
     'create.polygonal.basis',  'create.polynomial.basis', 
     'create.power.basis'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     #  Create an exponential basis over interval [0,5]
     #  with basis functions 1, exp(-t) and exp(-5t)
     basisobj <- create.exponential.basis(c(0,5),3,c(0,-1,-5))
     #  plot the basis
     plot(basisobj)
