     Results of canonical correlation analysis are often easier to
     interpret if they are rotated.  Among the many possible ways in
     which this rotation can be defined, the VARIMAX criterion seems to
     give satisfactory results most of the time.

   ccafd: an object of class "cca.fd" that is produced by function
          'cca.fd'. 

      nx: the number of points in a fine mesh of points that is
          required to approximate canonical variable functional data
          objects. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a rotated version of argument 'cca.fd'.
