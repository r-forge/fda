_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     51 measurements of the position of the lower lip every 7
     milliseconds for 20 repitions of the syllable 'bob'.

_F_o_r_m_a_t:

_l_i_p a matrix of dimension c(51, 20) giving the position of the lower
     lip every 7 milliseconds for 350 miliseconds.

_l_i_p_m_a_r_k_s a matrix of dimension c(20, 2) giving the positions of the
     'leftElbow' and 'rightElbow' in each of the 20 repitions of the
     syllable 'bob'.  

_l_i_p_t_i_m_e time in seconds from the start = seq(0, 0.35, 51) = every 7
     milliseconds.   

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     These are rather simple data, involving the movement of the lower
     lip while saying "bob".  There are 20 replications and 51 sampling
     points. The data are used to illustrate two techniques:  landmark
     registration and principal differental analysis.   Principal
     differential analysis estimates a linear differential equation
     that can be used to describe not only the observed curves, but
     also a  certain number of their derivatives.   For a rather more
     elaborate example of principal differential analysis,  see the
     handwriting data.
