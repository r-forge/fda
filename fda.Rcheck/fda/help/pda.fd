 xfdlist: a list whose members are functional data objects.  Each of
          these objects contain one or more functions that are
          variables to be represented by a differential equation.  The
          length of the list is the size of the system of differential
          equations. The number of replications must be the same for
          each member functional data object. 

 bwtlist: a list array with the first two dimensions are equal to the
          number of variables in the system (the length of list
          'xfdlist') and the last dimension equal to the order of each
          equation.  The order of the equations is assumed to be the
          same for each equation.  If only a single differential
          equation is involved, this argument can be an ordinary list
          with length equal to the order of the equation.

          Each member of 'bwtlist' defines a weight function in the
          system of linear differential equation.  For any equation,
          there can be a term in the equation for each order of
          derivative from 0 to m-1, where m is the order of the
          equation.  These derivatives can be those of each variable in
          the system, moreover.  Thus, a two-variable system of order 3
          can have, for each of the two equations, contributions from
          derivatives of order 0, 1 and 2 for each of the variables, or
          six terms in total.

          The first dimension of 'bwtlist' corresponds to equations,
          and the second dimension to contributions of variables for a
          fixed derivative within the equation defined by the first
          index.  The third index indicates the order of derivative of
          the contribution, which is one less than the index value.

          Each member of 'bwtlist' is a either a functional parameter
          object or a functional data object.  Functional data objects
          are converted to functional parameters objects with no
          smoothing. Functional parameter objects permit selected
          weight functions to be held fixed and not estimated.  These
          are often constant functions with the value 0, corresponding
          to variables and derivatives that make no contribution.

          For example, the harmonic acceleration differential equation
          would be of the form $D^3 x(t) = -b Dx(t)$ so that 'bwtlist'
          would be an ordinary list of length 3, each functional
          parameter object being defined with a constant basis, but
          only the second object would have a value of TRUE for the
          'estimate' slot, and the first and third coefficient
          functions would have value 0. 

 awtlist: a list containing weight functions for forcing functions.

          In addition to terms in each of the equations involving terms
          corresponding to each derivative of each variable in the
          system, each equation can also have a contribution from one
          or more exogenous variables, often called forcing functions.

          This argument defines the weights multiplying these forcing
          functions, and is a list array with first dimension equal to
          the number of variables or equations, and second dimension
          equal to the number of forcing functions. It is assumed that
          the number of forcing functions is the same for all
          equations. If only one forcing function is involved, or there
          is only one equation, then 'awtlist' can be an ordinary list.

          Each member is a functional parameter object (or a functional
          data object) defining a weighting function for a forcing
          function.  As with 'bwtlist', each of these weighting
          functions may be estimated or held fixed.  If the number of
          forcing functions actually varies from equation to equation,
          one can still use all forcing functions for all variables,
          but just weight unwanted ones in a particular equation by a
          fixed zero function.

          Each member's functional data object has only a single
          replicate. 

 ufdlist: a list containing forcing functions. This is a list array of
          the same size as 'awtlist' and each member is a functional
          data object corresponding to a forcing function. The number
          of replicates must be equal to that of the variables
          themselves, which is assumed to be the same for all
          variables. 

   nfine: a number of values for a fine mesh. The estimation of the
          differential equation involves discrete numerical quadrature
          estimates of integrals, and these require that functions be
          evaluated at a fine mesh of values of the argument.  This
          argument defines the number to use.  If not constant, this
          number is set to five times the largest number of basis
          functions used to represent any variable in the system. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a named list of length 3 with components:

 bwtlist: a list array of the same dimensions as the corresponding
          argument, containing the estimated or fixed weight functions
          defining the system of linear differential equations. 

resfdlist: a list of length equal to the number of variables or
          equations.  Each members is a functional data object giving
          the residual functions or forcing functions defined as the
          left side of the equation (the derivative of order m of a
          variable) minus the linear fit on the right side.  The number
          of replicates for each residual functional data object is the
          same as that for the variables. 

 awtlist: a list of the same dimensions as the corresponding argument. 
          Each member is an estimated or fixed weighting function for a
          forcing function.
