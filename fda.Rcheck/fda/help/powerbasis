_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Evaluates a set of power basis functions, or a derivative of these
     functions, at a set of arguments.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     powerbasis(x, exponents, nderiv=0)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a vector of argument values at which the power basis
          functions are to evaluated. Since exponents may be negative,
          for example after differentiation, it is required that all
          argument values be positive. 

exponents: a vector of exponents defining the power basis functions. 
          If $y$ is such a rate value, the corresponding basis function
          is $x$ to the power $y$.  The number of basis functions is
          equal to the number of exponents. 

  nderiv: the derivative to be evaluated.  The derivative must not
          exceed the order.  The default derivative is 0, meaning that
          the basis functions themselves are evaluated. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a matrix of function values.  The number of rows equals the number
     of arguments, and the number of columns equals the number of basis
     functions.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'create.power.basis',  'powerpen'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     #  set up a set of 10 positive argument values.
     x <- seq(0.1,1,0.1)
     #  compute values for three power basis functions
     exponents <- c(0, 1, 2)
     #  evaluate the basis matrix
     basismat <- powerbasis(x, exponents)
