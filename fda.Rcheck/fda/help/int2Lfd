_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function turns an integer specifying an order of a derivative
     into the equivalent linear differential operator object.  It is
     also useful for checking that an object is of the "Lfd" class.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     int2Lfd(m=0)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       m: either a nonnegative integer or a linear differential
          operator object. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a linear differential operator object of the "Lfd" class that is
     equivalent to the integer argument.
