_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The system of differential equations is linear, with possibly
     time-varying coefficient functions. The numerical solution is
     computed with the Runge-Kutta method.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     odesolv(bwtlist, ystart=diag(rep(1,norder)),
             h0=width/100, hmin=width*1e-10, hmax=width*0.5,
             EPS=1e-4, MAXSTP=1000)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 bwtlist: a list whose members are functional parameter objects
          defining the weight functions for the linear differential
          equation. 

  ystart: a vector of initial values for the equations.  These are the
          values at time 0 of the solution and its first m - 1
          derivatives. 

      h0: a positive initial step size. 

    hmin: the minimum allowable step size. 

    hmax: the maximum allowable step size. 

     EPS: a convergence criterion. 

  MAXSTP: the maximum number of steps allowed. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     This function is required to compute a set of solutions of an
     estimated linear differential equation in order compute a fit to
     the data that solves the equation.  Such a fit will be a linear
     combinations of m independent solutions.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a named list of length 2 containing

      tp: a vector of time values at which the system is evaluated 

      yp: a matrix of variable values corresponding to 'tp'.
