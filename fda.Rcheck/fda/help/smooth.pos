_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A set of data is smoothed with a functional data object that only
     takes positive values.  For example, this function can be used to
     estimate a smooth variance function from a set of squared
     residuals. A function $W(t)$ is estimated such that that the
     smoothing function is $exp[W(t)]$.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     smooth.pos(argvals, y, WfdParobj, wtvec=rep(1,n),
                conv=.0001, iterlim=50, dbglev=1)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 argvals: Argument value array of length N, where N is the number of
          observed curve values for each curve.  It is assumed that
          that these argument values are common to all observed curves.
           If this is not the case, you will need to run this function
          inside one or more loops, smoothing each curve separately. 

       y: Function value array (the values to be fit).  If the
          functional data are univariate, this array will be an N by
          NCURVE matrix, where N is the number of observed curve values
          for each curve and NCURVE is the number of curves observed. 
          If the functional data are muliivariate, this array will be
          an N by NCURVE by NVAR matrix, where NVAR the number of
          functions observed per case.  For example, for the gait data,
          NVAR = 2, since we observe knee and hip angles. 

WfdParobj: A functional parameter or fdPar object.  This object
          contains the specifications for the functional data object to
          be estimated by smoothing the data.  See comment lines in
          function fdPar for details.  The functional data object WFD
          in WFDPAROBJ is used to initialize the optimization process. 
          Its coefficient array contains the starting values for the
          iterative minimization of mean squared error. 

   wtvec: a vector of weights to be used in the smoothing. 

    conv: a convergence criterion. 

 iterlim: the maximum number of iterations allowed in the minimization
          of error sum of squares. 

  dbglev: either 0, 1, or 2.  This controls the amount information
          printed out on each iteration, with 0 implying no output, 1
          intermediate output level, and 2 full output.  If either
          level 1 or 2 is specified, it can be helpful to turn off the
          output buffering feature of S-PLUS. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a named list of length 4 containing:

  Wfdobj: a functional data object defining function $W(x)$ that that
          optimizes the fit to the data of the monotone function that
          it defines. 

   Flist: a named list containing three results for the final converged
          solution: (1) *f*: the optimal function value being
          minimized, (2) *grad*: the gradient vector at the optimal
          solution, and (3) *norm*: the norm of the gradient vector at
          the optimal solution.
