_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A set of data is smoothed with a functional data object that only
     takes positive values.  For example, this function can be used to
     estimate a smooth variance function from a set of squared
     residuals. A function $W(t)$ is estimated such that that the
     smoothing function is $exp[W(t)]$.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     smooth.pos(argvals, y, WfdParobj, wt=rep(1,nobs),
                conv=.0001, iterlim=20, dbglev=1)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 argvals: a vector of argument values. 

       y: a vector of data values.  This function can only smooth one
          set of data at a time. 

WfdParobj: a functional parameter object that provides an initial value
          for the coefficients defining function $W(t)$, and a
          roughness penalty on this function. 

      wt: a vector of weights to be used in the smoothing. 

    conv: a convergence criterion. 

 iterlim: the maximum number of iterations allowed in the minimization
          of error sum of squares. 

  dbglev: either 0, 1, or 2.  This controls the amount information
          printed out on each iteration, with 0 implying no output, 1
          intermediate output level, and 2 full output.  If either
          level 1 or 2 is specified, it can be helpful to turn off the
          output buffering feature of S-PLUS. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a named list of length 4 containing:

  Wfdobj: a functional data object defining function $W(x)$ that that
          optimizes the fit to the data of the monotone function that
          it defines. 

   Flist: a named list containing three results for the final converged
          solution: (1) *f*: the optimal function value being
          minimized, (2) *grad*: the gradient vector at the optimal
          solution,   and (3) *norm*: the norm of the gradient vector
          at the optimal solution. 

 iternum: the number of iterations. 

 iternum: the number of iterations. 

iterhist: a 'iternum+1' by 5 matrix containing the iteration history. 

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'smooth.monotone',  'smooth.morph'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     #See the analyses of the daily weather data for examples.
