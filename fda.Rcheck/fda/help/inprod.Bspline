_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Computes the matrix of inner products when both functions are
     represented by B-spline expansions and when both derivatives are
     integers.  This function is called by function 'inprod', and is
     not normally used directly.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     inprod.bspline(fdobj1, fdobj2=fdobj1, nderiv1=0, nderiv2=0)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  fdobj1: a functional data object having a B-spline basis function
          expansion. 

  fdobj2: a second functional data object with a B-spline basis
          function expansion.  By default, this is the same as the
          first argument. 

 nderiv1: a nonnegative integer specifying the derivative for the first
          argument. 

 nderiv2: a nonnegative integer specifying the derivative for the
          second argument. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a matrix of inner products with number of rows equal to the number
     of replications of the first argument and number of columns equal
     to the number of replications of the second object.
