_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A basis is set up for constructing polygonal lines, consisting of 
     straight line segments that join together.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     create.polygonal.basis(argvals=NULL, dropind=NULL,
                            quadvals=NULL, values=NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 argvals: a strictly increasing vector of argument values at which line
          segments join to form a polygonal line. 

 dropind: a vector of integers specifiying the basis functions to be
          dropped, if any.  For example, if it is required that a
          function be zero at the left boundary, this is achieved by
          dropping the first basis function, the only one that is
          nonzero at that point. Default value NULL. 

quadvals: a matrix with two columns and a number of rows equal to the
          number of argument values used to approximate an integral
          using Simpson's rule.  The first column contains these
          argument values.   A minimum of 5 values are required for
          each inter-knot interval, and that is often enough. These are
          equally spaced between two adjacent knots. The second column
          contains the weights used for Simpson's rule.  These are
          proportional to 1, 4, 2, 4, ..., 2, 4, 1. 

  values: a list containing the basis functions and their derivatives
          evaluated at the quadrature points contained in the first
          column of ' quadvals '. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The actual basis functions consist of triangles, each with its
     apex over an argument value. Note that in effect the polygonal
     basis is identical to a B-spline basis of order 2 and a knot or
     break value at each argument value.  The range of the polygonal
     basis is set to the interval defined by the smallest and largest
     argument values.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a basis object with the type 'polyg'.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'basisfd',  'create.bspline.basis',  'create.constant.basis', 
     'create.exponential.basis',  'create.fourier.basis', 
     'create.monomial.basis',  'create.polynomial.basis', 
     'create.power.basis'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     #  Create a polygonal basis over the interval [0,1]
     #  with break points at 0, 0.1, ..., 0.95, 1
     (basisobj <- create.polygonal.basis(seq(0,1,0.1)))
     #  plot the basis
     plot(basisobj)
