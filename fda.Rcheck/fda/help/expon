_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Evaluates a set of exponential basis functions, or a derivative of
     these functions, at a set of arguments.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     expon(x, ratevec=1, nderiv=0)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a vector of values at which the basis functions are to be
          evaluated. 

 ratevec: a vector of rate or time constants defining the exponential
          functions.  That is, if $a$ is the value of an element of
          this vector, then the corresponding basis function is
          $exp(at)$. The number of basis functions is equal to the
          length of 'ratevec'. 

  nderiv: a nonnegative integer specifying an order of derivative to be
          computed.  The default is 0, or the basis function value. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     There are no restrictions on the rate constants.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a matrix of basis function values with rows corresponding to
     argument values and columns to basis functions.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'exponpen'
