_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The degree of roughness of an estimated function is controlled by
     a smoothing parameter $lambda$ that directly multiplies the
     penalty. However, it can be difficult to interpret or choose this
     value, and it is often easier to determine the roughness by
     choosing a value that is equivalent of the degrees of freedom used
     by the smoothing procedure. This function converts a multipler
     $lambda$ into a degrees of freedom value.

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

 argvals: a vector containing the argument values used in the smooth of

basisobj: the basis object used in the smoothing of the data. 

   wtvec: the weight vector, if any, that was used in the smoothing of
          the data. 

  Lfdobj: the linear differential operator object used to defining the
          roughness penalty employed in smoothing the data.
