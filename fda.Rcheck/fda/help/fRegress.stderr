_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Function 'fRegress' carries out a functional regression analysis
     of the concurrent kind, and estimates a regression coefficient
     function corresponding to each independent variable, whether it is
     scalar or functional.  This function uses the list that is output
     by 'fRegress' to provide standard error functions for each
     regression function.  These standard error functions are
     pointwise, meaning that sampling standard deviation functions only
     are computed, and not sampling covariances.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     fRegress.stderr(fRegressList, y2cMap, SigmaE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

fRegressList: the named list of length six that is returned from a call
          to function 'fRegress'. 

  y2cMap: a matrix that contains the linear transformation that takes
          the raw data values into the coefficients defining a smooth
          functional data object. Typically, this matrix is returned
          from a call to function 'smooth.basis' that generates the
          dependent variable objects.  If the dependent variable is
          scalar, this matrix is an identity matrix of order equal to
          the length of the vector. 

  SigmaE: either a matrix or a bivariate functional data object
          according to whether the dependent variable is scalar or
          functional, respectively. This object has a number of
          replications equal to the length of the dependent variable
          object.  It contains an estimate of the variance-covariance
          matrix or function for the residuals. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a named list of length 3 containing:

betastderrlist: a list object of length the number of independent
          variables. Each member contains a functional parameter object
          for the standard error of a regression function. 

    bvar: a symmetric matrix containing sampling variances and
          covariances for the matrix of regression coefficients for the
          regression functions.  These are stored column-wise in
          defining BVARIANCE. 

  c2bMap: a matrix containing the mapping from response variable
          coefficients to coefficients for regression coefficients. 

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'fRegress',  'fRegress.CV'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     #See the weather data analyses in the file this-is-escaped-codenormal-bracket29bracket-normal for
     #examples of the use of function this-is-escaped-codenormal-bracket30bracket-normal.
