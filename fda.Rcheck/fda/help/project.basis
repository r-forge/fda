_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     A vector or matrix of discrete data is projected into the space
     spanned by the values of a set of basis functions.  This amounts
     to a least squares regression of the data on to the values of the
     basis functions.  A small penalty can be applied to deal with
     stiautions in which the number of basis functions exceeds the
     number of basis points. This function is used with function
     'data2fd', and is not normally used directly in a functional data
     analysis.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     project.basis(y, argvals, basisobj, penalize=FALSE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       y: a vector or matrix of discrete data. 

 argvals: a vector containing the argument values correspond to the
          values in 'y'. 

basisobj: a basis object. 

penalize: a logical variable.  If TRUE, a small roughness penalty is
          applied to ensure that the linear equations defining the
          least squares solution are linearly independent or
          nonsingular. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     the matrix of coefficients defining the least squares
     approximation. This matrix has as many rows are there are basis
     functions, as many columns as there are curves, and if the data
     are multivariate, as many layers as there are functions.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'data2fd'
