_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Evaluates a set of Fourier basis functions, or a derivative of
     these functions, at a set of arguments.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     fourier(x, nbasis=n, period=span, nderiv=0)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a vector of argument values at which the Fourier basis
          functions are to be evaluated. 

  nbasis: the number of basis functions in the Fourier basis.  The
          first basis function is the constant function, followed by
          sets of  sine/cosine pairs.  Normally the number of basis
          functions will be an odd.  The default number is the number
          of argument values. 

  period: the width of an interval over which all sine/cosine basis
          functions repeat themselves. The default is the difference
          between the largest and smallest argument values. 

  nderiv: the derivative to be evaluated.  The derivative must not
          exceed the order.  The default derivative is 0, meaning that
          the basis functions themselves are evaluated. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a matrix of function values.  The number of rows equals the number
     of arguments, and the number of columns equals the number of basis
     functions.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'fourierpen'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     #  set up a set of 11 argument values
     x <- seq(0,1,0.1)
     names(x) <- paste("x", 0:10, sep="")
     #  compute values for five Fourier basis functions
     #  with the default period (1) and derivative (0)
     (basismat <- fourier(x, 5))

     # Create a false Fourier basis, i.e., nbasis = 1
     # = a constant function
     fourier(x, 1)
