_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Evaluates a set of polygonal basis functions, or a derivative of
     these functions, at a set of arguments.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     polyg(x, argvals, nderiv=0)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a vector of argument values at which the polygonal basis
          functions are to evaluated. 

 argvals: a strictly increasing set of argument values containing the
          range of x within it that defines the polygonal basis.  The
          default is x itself. 

  nderiv: the order of derivative to be evaluated.  The derivative must
          not exceed one.  The default derivative is 0, meaning that
          the basis functions themselves are evaluated. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a matrix of function values.  The number of rows equals the number
     of arguments, and the number of columns equals the number of basis

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'create.polygonal.basis',  'polygpen'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     #  set up a set of 21 argument values
     x <- seq(0,1,0.05)
     #  set up a set of 11 argument values
     argvals <- seq(0,1,0.1)
     #  with the default period (1) and derivative (0)
     basismat <- polyg(x, argvals)
     #  plot the basis functions
     matplot(x, basismat, type="l")
