_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The 'svd' function in R 2.5.1 occasionally throws an error with a
     cryptic message.  In some such cases, changing the LINPACK
     argument works.

_U_s_a_g_e:

       svd2(x, nu = min(n, p), nv = min(n, p), LINPACK = FALSE)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

x, nu, nv, LINPACK: as for the 'svd' function in the 'base' package. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     In R 2.5.1, the 'svd' function sometimes stops with a cryptic
     error message for a matrix x for which a second call to 'svd' with
     !LINPACK will produce an answer.  When such conditions occur,
     assign 'x' with attributes 'nu', 'nv', and 'LINPACK' to
     '.svd.LINPACK.error.matrix' in 'env = .GlobalEnv'.

     Except for these rare pathologies, 'svd2' should work the same as
     'svd'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a list with components d, u, and v, as described in the help file
     for 'svd' in the 'base' package.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:
