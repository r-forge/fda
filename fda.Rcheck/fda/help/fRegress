_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function carries out a functional regression analysis, where
     either the dependent variable or one or more independent variables
     are functional.  Non-functional variables may be included on
     either side of the equation.  In a concurrent functional linear
     model all function variables are all evaluated at a common time or
     argument value $t$.   That is, the fit is defined in terms of the
     behavior of all variables at a fixed time, or in terms of "now"
     behavior.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     fRegress(yfdPar, xfdlist, betalist, wt=rep(1,N))

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  yfdPar: the dependent variable object.  It may be an object of three
          possible classes:

             *  a vector if the dependent variable is scalar.

             *  a functional data object if the dependent variable is
                functional.

             *  a functional parameter object if the dependent variable
                is functional,    and if it is necessary to smooth the
                prediction of the dependent variable.

 xfdlist: a list of length equal to the number of independent
          variables. Members of this list are the independent
          variables.  They be objects of either of these two classes:


             *  a vector if the independent dependent variable is
                scalar.

             *  a functional data object if the dependent variable is
                functional.

          In either case, the object must have the same number of
          replications as the dependent variable object.  That is, if
          it is a scalar, it must be of the same length as the
          dependent variable, and if it is functional, it must have the
          same number of replications as the dependent variable. 

betalist: a list of length equal to the number of independent
          variables. Members of this list define the regression
          functions to be estimated. They are functional parameter
          objects.  Note that even if corresponding independent
          variable is scalar, its regression coefficient will be
          functional if the dependent variable is functional.  Each of
          these functional parameter objects defines a single
          functional data object, that is, with only one replication. 

      wt: weights for weighted least squares  

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     In the computation of regression function estimates, all
     independent variables are treated as if they are functional.  If
     argument 'xfdlist' contains one or more vectors, these are
     converted to functional data objects having the constant basis
     with coefficients equal to the elements of the vector.

     Needless to say, if all the variables in the model are scalar, use
     this function, but rather either 'ls' or 'lsfit'.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a named list of length 6 with these members:

  yfdPar: yhe first argument in the call to 'fRegress'. 

 xfdlist: the second argument in the call to 'fRegress'. 

betalist: the third argument in the call to 'fRegress'. 

betaestlist: a list of length equal to the number of independent
          variables and with members having the same functional
          parameter structure as the corresponding members of
          'betalist'.  These are the estimated regression coefficient
          functions. 

yhatfdobj: a functional data object if the dependent variable is
          functional or a vector if the dependent variable is scalar. 
          This is the set of predicted by the functional regression
          model for the dependent variable. 

 Cmatinv: a matrix containing the inverse of the coefficient matrix for
          the linear equations that define the solution to the
          regression problem.  This matrix is required for function 
          'fRegress.stderr' that estimates confidence regions for the
          regression coefficient function estimates. 

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'fRegress.stderr',  'fRegress.CV',  'linmod'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     #See the Canadian daily weather data analyses in the file
     # this-is-escaped-code{ for 
     #examples of all the cases covered by this-is-escaped-codenormal-bracket48bracket-normal.
