     TIMES for (two basis objects sets up a basis suitable for
     expanding the pointwise product of two functional data objects
     with these respective bases.  In the absence of a true product
     basis system in this code, the rules followed are inevitably a
     compromise: (1) if both bases are B-splines, the norder is the sum
     of the two orders - 1, and the breaks are the union of the two
     knot sequences, each knot multiplicity being the maximum of the
     multiplicities of the value in the two break sequences. That is,
     no knot in the product knot sequence will have a multiplicity
     greater than the multiplicities of this value in the two knot
     sequences.   The rationale this rule is that order of
     differentiability of the product at eachy value will be controlled
      by whichever knot sequence has the greater multiplicity.   In the
     case where one of the splines is order 1, or a step function, the
     problem is dealt with by replacing the original knot values by
     multiple values at that location to give a discontinuous
     derivative. (2) if both bases are Fourier bases, AND the periods
     are the  the same, the product is a Fourier basis with number of
     basis functions the sum of the two numbers of basis fns. (3) if
     only one of the bases is B-spline, the product basis is B-spline
     with the same knot sequence and order two higher. (4) in all other
     cases, the product is a B-spline basis with number of basis
     functions equal to the sum of the two numbers of bases and equally
     spaced knots.
