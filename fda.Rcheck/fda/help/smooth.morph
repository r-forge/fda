_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function is nearly identical to 'smooth.monotone' but is
     intended to compute a smooth monotone transformation $h(t)$ of
     argument $t$ such that $h(0) = 0$ and $h(TRUE) = TRUE$, where $t$
     is the upper limit of $t$.  This function is used primarily to
     register curves.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     smooth.morph(x, y, WfdPar, wt=rep(1,nobs),
                  conv=.0001, iterlim=20, dbglev=0)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a vector of argument values. 

       y: a vector of data values.  This function can only smooth one
          set of data at a time. 

  WfdPar: a functional parameter object that provides an initial value
          for the coefficients defining function $W(t)$, and a
          roughness penalty on this function. 

      wt: a vector of weights to be used in the smoothing. 

    conv: a convergence criterion. 

 iterlim: the maximum number of iterations allowed in the minimization
          of error sum of squares. 

  dbglev: either 0, 1, or 2.  This controls the amount information
          printed out on each iteration, with 0 implying no output, 1
          intermediate output level, and 2 full output.  If either
          level 1 or 2 is specified, it can be helpful to turn off the
          output buffering feature of S-PLUS. 

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A named list of length 4 containing:

  Wfdobj: a functional data object defining function $W(x)$ that that
          optimizes the fit to the data of the monotone function that
          it defines. 

   Flist: a named list containing three results for the final converged
          solution: (1) *f*: the optimal function value being
          minimized, (2) *grad*: the gradient vector at the optimal
          solution, and (3) *norm*: the norm of the gradient vector at
          the optimal solution. 

 iternum: the number of iterations. 

iterhist: a '' by 5 matrix containing the iteration history. 

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'smooth.monotone', 'landmarkreg', 'register.fd'
