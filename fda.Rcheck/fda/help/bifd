_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     This function creates a bivariate functional data object, which
     consists of two bases for expanding a functional data object of
     two  variables, s and t, and a set of coefficients defining this
     expansion. The bases are contained in "basisfd" objects.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     bifd (coef=matrix(0,2,1), sbasisobj=create.bspline.basis(),
           tbasisobj=create.bspline.basis(), fdnames=defaultnames)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    coef: a two-, three-, or four-dimensional array containing
          coefficient values for the expansion of each set of bivariate
          function values=terms of a set of basis function values

          If 'coef' is two dimensional, this implies that there is only
          one variable and only one replication.  In that case,  the
          first and second dimensions correspond to the basis functions
          for the first and second argument, respectively.

          If 'coef' is three dimensional, this implies that there are
          multiple replicates on only one variable.  In that case,  the
          first and second dimensions correspond to the basis functions
          for the first and second argument, respectively, and the
          third dimension corresponds to replications.

          If 'coef' has four dimensions, the fourth dimension
          corresponds to variables. 

sbasisobj: a functional data basis object for the first argument s of
          the bivariate function.   

tbasisobj: a functional data basis object for the second argument t of
          the bivariate function.   

 fdnames: A list of length 4 containing dimnames for 'coefs' if it is a
          4-dimensional array.  If it is only 2- or 3-dimensional, the
          later components of fdnames are not applied to 'coefs'.  In
          any event, the components of fdnames describe the following:

          (1) The row of 'coefs' corresponding to the bases in
          sbasisobj. Defaults to sbasisobj[["names"]] if non-null and
          of the proper length, or to existing dimnames(coefs)[[1]] if
          non-null and of the proper length, and to 's1', 's2', ...,
          otherwise.  

          (2) The columns of 'coefs' corresponding to the bases in
          tbasisobj. Defaults to tbasisobj[["names"]] if non-null and
          of the proper length, or to existing dimnames(coefs)[[2]] if
          non-null and of the proper length, and to 't1', 't2', ...,  
          otherwise.  

          (3) The replicates.  Defaults to dimnames(coefs)[[3]] if
          non-null and of the proper length, and to 'rep1', ...,
          otherwise.

          (4) Variable names.  Defaults to dimnames(coefs)[[4]] if
          non-null and of the proper length, and to 'var1', ...,
          otherwise.   

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A bivariate functional data object = a list of class 'bifd'  with
     the following components:

   coefs: the input 'coefs' possible with dimnames from dfnames if
          provided or from sbasisobj$names and tbasisobsj$names 

sbasisobj: a functional data basis object for the first argument s of
          the bivariate function.   

tbasisobj: a functional data basis object for the second argument t of
          the bivariate function.   

bifdnames: a list of length 4 giving names for the dimensions of coefs,
          with one or two unused lists of names if length(dim(coefs))
          is only two or one, respectively.
