_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     The matrix being rotated contains the values of the component
     functional data objects computed in either a principal components
     analysis or a canonical correlation analysis. The values are
     computed over a fine mesh of argument values.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     varmx(amat)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    amat: the matrix to be rotated.  The number of rows is equal to the
          number of argument values 'nx' used in a fine mesh.  The
          number of columns is the number of components to be rotated. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The VARIMAX criterion is the variance of the squared component
     values. As this criterion is maximized with respect to a rotation
     of the space spanned by the columns of the matrix, the squared
     loadings tend more and more to be either near 0 or near 1, and
     this tends to help with the process of labelling or interpreting
     the rotated matrix.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a square rotation matrix of order equal to the number of
     components that are rotated.  A rotation matrix $T$ has that
     property that $T'T = TT' = I$.
