_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Evaluates a set of B-spline basis functions, or a derivative of
     these functions, at a set of arguments.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     bsplineS(x, breaks, norder=4, nderiv=0)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: A vector of argument values at which the B-spline basis
          functions are to be evaluated. 

  breaks: A strictly increasing set of break values defining the
          B-spline basis.  The argument values 'x' should be within the
          interval spanned by the break values. 

  norder: The order of the B-spline basis functions.  The order less
          one is the degree of the piece-wise polynomials that make up
          any B-spline function. The default is order 4, meaning
          piece-wise cubic. 

  nderiv: A nonnegative integer specifying the order of derivative to
          be evaluated.  The derivative must not exceed the order.  The
          default  derivative is 0, meaning that the basis functions
          themselves are evaluated.  

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a matrix of function values.  The number of rows equals the number
     of  arguments, and the number of columns equals the number of
     basis functions.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     # Minimal example:  A B-spline of order 1 (i.e., a step function)
     # with 0 interior knots:
     bsplineS(seq(0, 1, .2), 0:1, 1, 0)

     #  set up break values at 0.0, 0.2,..., 0.8, 1.0.
     breaks <- seq(0,1,0.2)
     #  set up a set of 11 argument values
     x <- seq(0,1,0.1)
     #  the order willl be 4, and the number of basis functions
     #  is equal to the number of interior break values (4 here)
     #  plus the order, for a total here of 8.
     norder <- 4
     #  compute the 11 by 8 matrix of basis function values
     basismat <- bsplineS(x, breaks, norder)
