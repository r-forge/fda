_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     plot an lmWinsor model or list of models as line(s) with the data
     as points

_U_s_a_g_e:

     ## S3 method for class 'lmWinsor':
     plot(x, n=101, lty=1:9, col=1:9,
              lwd=c(2:4, rep(3, 6)), lty.y=c('dotted', 'dashed'),
              lty.x = lty.y, col.y=1:9, col.x= col.y, lwd.y = c(1.2, 1),
              lwd.x=lwd.y, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: an object of class 'lmWinsor', which is either a list of
          objects of class c('lmWinsor', 'lm') or is a single object of
          that double class.  Each object of class c('lmWinsor', 'lm')
          is the result of a single 'lmWinsor' fit.  If 'x' is a list,
          it summarizes multiple fits with different limits to the same
          data.   

       n: integer;  with only one explanatory variable 'xNames' in the
          model, 'n' is the number of values at which to evaluate the
          model predictions.  This is ignored if the number of
          explanatory variable 'xNames' in the model is different from
          1.   

lty, col, lwd, lty.y, lty.x, col.y, col.x, lwd.y, lwd.x: 'lty', 'col'
          and 'lwd' are each replicated to a length matching the number
          of fits summarized in 'x' and used with one line for each fit
          in the order appearing in 'x'.  The others refer to
          horizontal and vertical limit lines.  

     ...: optional arguments for 'plot'   

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     1.  One fit or several?  

     2.  How many explanatory variables are involved in the model(s) in
     'x'?  If only one, then the response variable is plotted vs. that
     one explanatory variable.  Otherwise, the response is plotted vs.
     predictions. 

     3.  Plot the data.

     4.  Plot one line for each fit with its limits.
