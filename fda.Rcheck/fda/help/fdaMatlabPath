     Write a sequence of Matlab commands to 'fdaMatlabPath.m' in the
     working directory containing commands to add 'fdaM' to the path
     for Matlab.

R.matlab: logical:  If TRUE, include '~R/library/R.matlab/externals' in
          the path.  If(missing(R.matlab)) include
          '~R/library/R.matlab/externals' only if R.matlab is

   _U_S_A_G_E If your Matlab installation does NOT have a 'startup.m' file,
        it might be wise to copy 'fdaMatlabPath.m' into a directory
        where Matlab would look for 'startup.m', then rename it to
        'startup.m'.

        If you have a 'startup.m', you could add the contents of
        'fdaMatlabPath.m' to 'startup.m'.

        Alternatively, you can copy 'fdaMatlabPath.m' into the
        directory containing 'startup.m' and add the following to the
        end of 'startup.m':

            if exist('fdaMatlabPath')  
                                       fdaMatlabPath ;
            end                        


   _A_L_G_O_R_I_T_H_M 1.  path2fdaM = path to the 'Matlab/fdaM' subdiretory of
        the 'fda' installation directory. 

        2.  Find all subdirectories of path2fdaM except those beginning
        in '@' or including 'private'. 

        3.  if(requires(R.matlab)) add the path to 'MatlabServer.m' to
        'dirs2add' 

        4.  d2a <- paste("addpath('", dirs2add, "');", sep='')

        5.  writeLines(d2a, 'fdaMatlabPath.m')

        6.  if(exists(startupFile)) append 'd2a' to it


_V_a_l_u_e:

     A character vector of Matlab 'addpath' commands is returned
     invisibly.
