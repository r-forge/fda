_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Adds an axis to the current plot, with tick marks delimiting
     interval described by labels

_U_s_a_g_e:

     axisIntervals(side, atTick1=monthBegin.5, atTick2=monthEnd.5,
           atLabels=monthMid, labels=month.abb, cex.axis=0.9, ...)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    side: an integer specifying which side of the plot the axis is to
          be drawn on.  The axis is placed as follows: 1=below, 2=left,
          3=above and 4=right. 

 atTick1: the points at which tick-marks marking the starting points of
          the intervals are to be drawn.  This defaults to
          'monthBegin.5' to mark monthly periods for an annual cycle. 
          These are constructed by calling axis(side, at=atTick1,
          labels=FALSE, ...).  For more detail on this, see 'axis'.   

 atTick2: the points at which tick-marks marking the ends of the
          intervals are to be drawn.  This defaults to 'monthBegin.5'
          to mark monthly periods for an annual cycle.  These are
          constructed by calling axis(side, at=atTick2, labels=FALSE,
          ...).  Use atTick2=NA to rely only on atTick1.  For more
          detail on this, see 'axis'.   

atLabels: the points at which 'labels' should be typed.  These are
          constructed by calling axis(side, at=atLabels, tick=FALSE,
          ...).  For more detail on this, see 'axis'.   

  labels: Labels to be typed at locations 'atLabels'.  This is
          accomplished by calling axis(side, at=atLabels,
          labels=labels, tick=FALSE, ...). For more detail on this, see
          'axis'.    

cex.axis: Character expansion (magnification) used for axis annotations
          ('labels' in this function call) relative to the current
          setting of 'cex'.  For more detail, see 'par'.     

    ... : additional arguments passed to  'axis'.  

_V_a_l_u_e:

     The value from the third (labels) call to 'axis'.  This function
     is usually invoked for its side effect, which is to add an axis to
     an already existing plot.

_S_i_d_e _E_f_f_e_c_t_s:

     An axis is added to the current plot.

_A_u_t_h_o_r(_s):

     Spencer Graves

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'axis',  'par' 'monthBegin.5' 'monthEnd.5' 'monthMid' 'month.abb'
     'monthLetters'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     daybasis65 <- create.fourier.basis(c(0, 365), 65)

     daytempfd <- with(CanadianWeather, data2fd(
            dailyAv[,,"Temperature.C"], day.5,
            daybasis65, argnames=list("Day", "Station", "Deg C")) )
      
     with(CanadianWeather, plotfit.fd(
           dailyAv[,,"Temperature.C"], argvals=day.5,
               daytempfd, index=1, titles=place, axes=FALSE) )
     # Label the horizontal axis with the month names
     axisIntervals(1) 
     axis(2)
     # Depending on the physical size of the plot,
     # axis labels may not all print.
     # In that case, there are 2 options:
     # (1) reduce 'cex.lab'.
     # (2) Use different labels as illustrated by adding
     #     such an axis to the top of this plot 

     axisIntervals(3, labels=monthLetters, cex.lab=1.2, line=-0.5) 
     # 'line' argument here is passed to 'axis' via '...'
