_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Creates a set of basis functions consisting of powers of the
     argument shifted by a constant.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     create.polynomial.basis(rangeval=c(0, 1), nbasis=2,
                             ctr=midrange, dropind=NULL,
                             quadvals=NULL, values=NULL)

_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

rangeval: a vector of length 2 defining the range. 

  nbasis: the number of basis functions. The default is 2, which
          defines a basis for straight lines. 

     ctr: this value is used to shift the argument prior to taking its
          power. 

 dropind: a vector of integers specifiying the basis functions to be
          dropped, if any.  For example, if it is required that a
          function be zero at the left boundary, this is achieved by
          dropping the first basis function, the only one that is
          nonzero at that point. Default value NULL. 

quadvals: a matrix with two columns and a number of rows equal to the
          number of argument values used to approximate an integral
          using Simpson's rule.  The first column contains these
          argument values. A minimum of 5 values are required for each
          inter-knot interval, and that is often enough. These are
          equally spaced between two adjacent knots. The second column
          contains the weights used for Simpson's rule.  These are
          proportional to 1, 4, 2, 4, ..., 2, 4, 1. 

  values: a list containing the basis functions and their derivatives
          evaluated at the quadrature points contained in the first
          column of ' quadvals '. 

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The only difference between a monomial and a polynomial basis is
     the use of a shift value.  This helps to avoid rounding error when
     the argument values are a long way from zero.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     a basis object with the type 'polynom'.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'basisfd',  'create.bspline.basis',  'create.constant.basis', 
     'create.fourier.basis',  'create.exponential.basis', 
     'create.monomial.basis',  'create.polygonal.basis', 
     'create.power.basis'

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     #  Create a polynomial basis over the years in the 20th century
     #  and center the basis functions on 1950.
     basisobj <- create.polynomial.basis(c(1900, 2000), nbasis=3, ctr=1950)
     #  plot the basis
     # The following should work but doesn't;  2007.05.01
     #plot(basisobj)
