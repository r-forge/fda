\title{
  Decomposition for Amplitude and Phase Variation
}
\description{
Registration is the process of aligning peaks, valleys and other features in a
sample of curves.  Once the registration has taken place, this function
computes two mean squared error measures, one for amplitude variation, and the
other for phase variation.  It also computes a squared multiple correlation
index of the amount of variation in the unregistered functions is due to 
phase.
}
\usage{
AmpPhaseDecomp(xfd, yfd, wfd)
}
\arguments{
  \item{xfd}{
    a functional data object containing the unregistered curves.
  }
  \item{yfd}{
    a functional data object containing the unregistered curves.
  }
  \item{wfd}{
    a functional data object defining the functions $w(t)$ that define 
    the strictly monotone warping functions $h(t)$.  This is typically
    returned by the functions \code{landmarkreg and \code{register.fd}.
  }
}
\value{
  a named list of length 2 with components:

  \item{MS.amp} { 
    the mean squared error for amplitude variation.
  }
  \item{MS.phas} { 
    the mean squared error for phase variation.
  }
  \item{RSQR} {
       the squared correlation measure of the  proportion of the
       total variation that is due to phase variation.
  \item{C} {
       a constant required for the decomposition.  Its value is one
       if the derivatives the warping functions are independent of the
       squared registered functions.
  }
}
\details{
  The decomposition can yield negative values for \code{MS.phas} if the 
  registration does not improve the alignment of the curves, or if used to
  compare two registration processes based on different principles, such as
  is the case for functions \code{landmarkreg and \code{register.fd}.
