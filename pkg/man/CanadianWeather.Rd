\title{
  Canadian average annual weather cycle
}
\description{
  Daily temperature and precipitation at 35 different locations
  in Canada averaged over 1960 to 1994.  
}
\usage{
CanadianWeather
daily
daytime
}
\format{
  'CanadianWeather' and 'daily' are lists containing essentially the
  same data.  'CanadianWeather' may be preferred for most purposes;
  'daily' is included primarily for compatability with scripts written
  before the other format became available and for compatability with
  the Matlab 'fda' code.

  \item{daytime}{ ((1:365) - 0.5)} 
  \item{CanadianWeather}{
    A list with the following components:

    \itemize{
      \item{dailyAv}{
	a three dimensional array c(365, 35, 3) summarizing data
	collected at 35 different weather stations in Canada on the
	following: 
	
	[[1]] Temperature.C:  average daily temperature for each day of
	the year 
	
	[[2]] Precipitation.mm:  average daily rainfall for each day of
	the year rounded to 0.1 mm.  

	[[3]] log10precip:  base 10 logarithm of Precipitation.mm after
	first replacing 27 zeros by 0.05 mm (Ramsay and Silverman 2006,
	p. 248).   
      }    
      \item{place}{
	Names of the 35 different weather stations in Canada whose data
	are summarized in 'dailyAv'.  These names vary between 6 and 11
	characters in length.  By contrast, daily[["place"]] which are
	all 11 characters, with names having fewer characters being
	extended with trailing blanks.  
      }
      \item{province}{
	names of the Canadian province containing each place
      }
      \item{coordinates}{
	a numeric matrix giving 'N.longitude' and 'W.latitude' for each
	place.  
      }
      \item{region}{
	Which of 4 climate zones contain each place:  Atlantic, Pacific,
	Continental, Arctic.  
      }
      \item{monthlyTemp}{
	A matrix of dimensions (12, 35) giving the average temperature
	in degrees celcius for each month of the year.  
      }
      \item{monthlyPrecip}{
	A matrix of dimensions (12, 35) giving the average daily 
	precipitation in milimeters for each month of the year.   
      }
      \item{geogindex}{
	Order the weather stations from East to West to North 
      }
    }
  }

  \item{daily}{
    A list with the following components:

    \itemize{
      \item{place}{
	Names of the 35 different weather stations in Canada whose data
	are summarized in 'dailyAv'.  These names are all 11 characters,
	with shorter names being extended with trailing blanks.  This is
	different from CanadianWeather[["place"]], where trailing blanks
	have been dropped.    
      }
      \item{tempav}{
	a matrix of dimensions (365, 35) giving the average temperature
	in degrees celcius for each day of the year.  This is
	essentially the same as CanadianWeather[["dailyAv"]][,,
	"Temperature.C"]. 
      }
      \item{precipav}{
	a matrix of dimensions (365, 35) giving the average temperature
	in degrees celcius for each day of the year.  This is
	essentially the same as CanadianWeather[["dailyAv"]][,,
	"Precipitation.mm"]. 
      }
