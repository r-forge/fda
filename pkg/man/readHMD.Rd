\description{
  Obtain data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) maintained at the
  University of California at Berkeley and the Max Planck Institute for
  Demographic Research.  To use \code{readHMD}, you must first obtain a
  \code{username} and \code{password} from HMD and supply them as
  arguments to this function.

  \item{dataType}{
    data type:  'lt' for 'life table'.  If a different data type is

\details{
  To use this function, you need a username and password with HMD.  As
  of 2012.07.28, the HMD access is free for individuals, but you must
  register with them.  To start the registration process, go to
  \url{http://www.mortality.org} and click "New User" near the top in
  the left margin.  Then click "New User" again to see the User
  Agreement.

  In all published work and presentations, please acknowledge the HMD as
  either the source or the intermediary of the data with the date on
  which you extracted the data.  See
  \url{http://www.mortality.org/mp/auth.pl} for recommended citation
  formats.

  If you agree to comply with their User Agreement, click "I agree" at
  the bottom of that page.  This will take you to another page where you
  can enter requested information about you including an email address
  to which your password will be mailed.

\value{
  If url is provided or dataType != 'lt' or \code{\link{read.table}}
  fails, this returns a list with the following components:

  \item{URL}{
    the URL that was used, being the argument \code{url} if provided or
    the url that was constructed after noting that it was missing.
  }
  \item{getURL}{
    object returned by \code{\link{getURL}}.

  \item{readLines}{
    object returned by readLines(getURL(...)).
  }
  \item{read.table}{
    object returned by read.table(getURL(...)).
  }

  Otherwise, this returns a list with the following components:

  \item{x}{ numeric vector of ages }
  \item{y}{ matrix of the data for each age-year combination }
  \item{time}{ numeric vector of the years }
  \item{xname}{ "age" }
