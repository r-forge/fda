### DISCLAIMER:
###
### These script files are incomplete and where complete 
### do not always reproduce exactly the images in the books.  
### Reason for this include the following:
###
### (1) The authors were given permission to publish the results
###     of thier analyses but not always the data.
### (2) These script files were produced starting in 2007
###     not by the authors to the books but by volunteer(s)
###     (initially Spencer Graves).  The published analyses
###     were conducted over more than a decade, and the details
###     of exactly how the published analyses were performed were
###     not in some cases still available.   
### (3) The software and capabilities of computers available
###     have improved over time.  In some cases, this produces
###     a better fit today than at the times the published analyses
###     were prepared.  
###
### It is hoped that these script files may still be useful,
### even with their gaps and even when they do not reproduce exactly
### the published analyses.
