            Functions for Functional Data Analysis in Matlab

                            4 September 2012


As of this release, the R-Project is no longer distributing the
Matlab versions of the functional data analysis functions and sample
analyses through the CRAN distribution system.

This is due to the pressure placed on storage required in the many
CRAN sites by the rapidly increasing number of R packages, of which
the fda package is one.  The three of us involved in this package
have agreed to help out this situation by switching to distributing
the Matlab functions and analyses through my personal ftp site at
McGill University.

Consequently, go to this site using an ftp utility:

http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/

There you find a set of .zip files containing the functions and
sample analyses, as well as two .txt files giving instructions for
installation and some additional information.
