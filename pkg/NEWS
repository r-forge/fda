Software and datasets to support 'Functional Data Analysis',
second edition (2006) and 'Applied Functional Data Analysis'
(2002), both by James O. Ramsay and Bernard W. Silverman
(Springer).

Release 2.0.1 added a map to CanadianWeather.Rd showing the
location of each weather station by region.

Release 2.0.0 added 'coef' generic functions to extract the
coefficients from objects of class 'fd', 'fdPar', and 'fdSmooth'.
Also, the 'coef' component in objects of class 'fdSmooth' was
removed as it was redundant with 'fd$coefs'.  In addition,
functions 'Fperm.fd' and and 'tperm.fd' were added, and a bug
was fixed in the addition of functional data objects.

Release 1.2.4 fixes a few bugs and adds defaults to
'smooth.basis' and 'smooth.basisPar' to make them easier to use.
The output of 'smooth.basis' and 'smooth.basisPar' now have class
'fdSmooth', with methods for 'plot', 'lines', and 'plotfit'.
There have also been improvements to the 'plotfit' function and
the 'CanadianWeather' data.  Also, a function 'norder' has been
added, which returns the order of a B-spline.

Release 1.2.3 adds to previous versions a script to create most
of the figures of chapter 6 of "Applied Functional Data Analysis"
by Ramsay and Silverman.  Other changes offer simpler calls to
time warping / registration and functional principal component
functions.

############################
Release 1.1.7 provides improved documentation and modifications
to some data sets.  Major modifications from previous releases:

MINOR INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS:

	  1.  The 'daily' data set now has a more descriptive name,
'CanadianWeather', and some enhancements;  see the help page.

	  2.  The 'melanoma' data set has been modified to match
the object of the same name in the 'lattice' package.  Accordingly,
the 'index' column has been deleted and the column name 'melanoma'
has been changed to 'incidence'.


ENHANCEMENTS

	  1.  New functions 'smooth.basisPar' and 'smooth.fdPar'
simplify common analysis flows that follow an isolated call to
'dfPar' with a call to either 'smooth.basis' or 'smooth.fd';  these
tasks can now be performed in one step rather than two.

	  2.  A new function 'phaseplanePlot' simplifies the
process of plotting "Acceleration" vs. "Velocity".

	  3.  A new function 'axisIntervals' facilitates labeling
months and quarters on plots.

	  4.  A 'scripts' subdirectory now includes partial scripts
to replicate some of the analyses in the books.

	  5.  There have been numerous enhancements to help pages.
